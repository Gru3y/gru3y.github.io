# BOTSv2 Dataset
The data included in this app was generated in August of 2017 by members of Splunk's Security Specialist team - Dave Herrald, Ryan Kovar, Steve Brant, Jim Apger, John Stoner, Ken Westin, David Veuve and James Brodsky. They stood up a few lab environments connected to the Internet. Within the environment they had a few Windows endpoints instrumented with the Splunk Universal Forwarder and Splunk Stream. The forwarders were configured with best practices for Windows endpoint monitoring, including a full Microsoft Sysmon deployment and best practices for Windows Event logging. The environment included a Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewall to capture traffic and provide web proxy services, and Suricata to provide network-based IDS.
